# Pike v0.1
HTML5 gamedeveloper library. 

All classes in this library are based on the [Google Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/).

##About
The basic idea is to create a library of reusable classes for game developers. 
**This is not a framework**. Because the framework is always tied to some restrictions and rules. 
There are no restrictions, here are the basic classes.

##Covers
- Resource loader (TODO)
- Input handler (TODO)
- Canvas renderer (TODO)
- Collision detection (TODO)
- Animation (TODO)
- Audio (TODO)
- Math (TODO)
