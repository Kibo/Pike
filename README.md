# Pike v0.2
HTML5 gamedeveloper library.
All classes in this library are based on the [Google Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/).

###About
The basic idea is to create a library of reusable classes for game developers. 
**This is not a framework**. Because the framework is always tied to some restrictions and rules. 
There are no restrictions, here are the basic classes.
